# What this program does

This program implements a parser and lexer for a small language built to track
changes in balances. It then generates a report based on that information.

The grammar for this language can be found in the file
[`grammar.enbf`](grammar.enbf). An example of the language can be found in
the file [`example.txt`](example.txt) while a sample of the historical logs
generated by the program can be found in [`output.txt`](output.txt).

What the output actually looks like may vary, though I am fairly certain that
the format of the input is solidified.
