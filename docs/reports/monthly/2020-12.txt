      will be used solely for the betterment of Agora. Any player CAN
      flip a contract's donation level to 0 with Agoran consent.

      Whenever a payday occurs, half of each charity's coin holdings
      (rounded down) are destroyed, and then each charity earns a number
      of coins equal to its donation level times 4.6212.
