      value with 3 Agoran consent. This SHOULD only be done if the

      will be used solely for the betterment of Agora. Any player CAN
      flip a contract's donation level to 0 with Agoran consent.

      Whenever a payday occurs, half of each charity's coin holdings

      of coins equal to its donation level times 10.0000.
