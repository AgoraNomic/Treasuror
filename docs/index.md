# The Treasuror

Welcome to the Treasuror's subsite! The Treasuror is an officer of Agora
tasked with keeping track of everyone's holdings of "assets" (in-game
items that can be owned).

The economic systems present in Agora Nomic are ever-changing. Sometimes
the only asset that needs to be tracked is coins. Sometimes (such as
right now) there are nine different assets that need to be tracked. Ever
since 2018, it has been the Treasuror's job to track whatever assets tie
in with the economic system.

I am Trigon, the current Treasuror. I am building this subsite mainly to
host old reports, but I may create an economics FAQ at some point for
new players, and maybe some more useful stuff later. We'll just see.

Here is what is currently hosted here:

* **[The Report Archives](reports)** Starting from early in 2019, these
  archives contain the reports of Treasurors past and present.
